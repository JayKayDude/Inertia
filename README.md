# Inertia

**Smooth, physics-based mouse scrolling for Mac.**

Inertia replaces the stepped, clunky feel of mouse wheel scrolling on macOS with smooth inertial scrolling — giving any mouse the natural momentum feel of a trackpad.

---

## Features (v0.8)

- **Smooth inertial scrolling** — physics-based momentum that coasts naturally after each wheel tick
- **Speed presets** — Slow, Medium, Fast (plus Custom)
- **Smoothness presets** — Off, Low, Regular, High
- **Base Speed slider** — always visible, fine-grained control
- **Advanced controls** — Curve Steepness, Momentum Duration, Minimum Tick Size
- **Live preview** — test your settings inside the app
- **Lightweight menubar app** — no Dock icon, runs silently in the background
- **Mouse-only** — trackpad behavior is left completely untouched

## Planned for v1.0

- Visual draggable curve editor
- Per-app scroll profiles
- Import/export settings

---

## Requirements

- macOS Sequoia (15.0) or later
- A USB or Bluetooth mouse with a scroll wheel
- Accessibility permission (required for scroll event interception)

---

## Installation

> Coming soon — v0.8 in development.

## Based On

Inertia's scroll physics are adapted from [Mac Mouse Fix](https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix) by Noah Nuebling. Inertia is a derivative work with substantial changes: completely rewritten engine in pure Swift, new SwiftUI interface, stripped to smooth scrolling only, and released free and open source. Full attribution to the original author is maintained.
