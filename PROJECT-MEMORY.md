## Project Identity
- **Name:** Inertia
- **Type:** macOS menubar app
- **Purpose:** Replaces stepped mouse wheel scrolling with smooth, physics-based inertial scrolling
- **Created:** 2026-02-18
- **Author:** Jayke Collier
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/JayKayDude/Inertia
- **License:** Open source, free
- **Target OS:** macOS Sequoia (15.0+)

## Foundation
- Built from scratch in **pure Swift/SwiftUI** — no Obj-C bridging
- Uses MMF's physics formulas as **reference only** (not forked code)
- Speedup curve: `y = a * pow(1.1, (x-t) * c) + 1 - a` (b=1.1, p=1.33, t=8)
- Language: Swift 5.9+
- UI: SwiftUI
- Editor: VS Code + Claude Code + Xcode

## Architectural Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Status |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| 2026-02-18 | Governance docs created at project root | Standard AI governance initialization | Active |
| 2026-02-18 | Menubar-only app, no Dock icon | Lightweight background utility pattern | Active |
| 2026-02-18 | Intercept mouse wheel events only, leave trackpads alone | Trackpads already have system-level inertia | Active |
| 2026-02-19 | **Build from scratch, not fork MMF** | MMF is Obj-C with deep dependencies; clean Swift rewrite is simpler | Active |
| 2026-02-19 | **v1.0/v2.0 versioning** | v1.0 = initial release, v2.0 = curve editor + per-app profiles | Active |
| 2026-02-19 | **Smoothness presets: Low/Regular/High** | ~~Off/Low/Regular/High~~ — Off removed since smooth scrolling is the app's purpose | Active |
| 2026-02-19 | Base Speed slider always visible | Most users only need one slider | Active |
| 2026-02-19 | Preset ↔ slider sync with "Custom" label | Selecting preset moves slider; dragging away shows Custom | Active |
| 2026-02-20 | **MMF event construction**: CGEvent(source: nil), field 55=22, three delta fields | Terminal and other apps read different delta fields; must set all three consistently | Active |
| 2026-02-20 | **Direction-only rawDelta** | MMF ignores rawDelta magnitude, only uses sign; prevents per-app scroll speed inconsistency | Active |
| 2026-02-20 | **Half-life friction model** | `friction = pow(0.5, 1/halfLifeFrames)` — approximates MMF's drag curve | Active |
| 2026-02-20 | **NSLock for thread safety** | DispatchQueue.sync caused deadlocks (CGEvent.post dispatches to main thread) | Active |
| 2026-02-20 | **Custom Binding for enable toggle** | @AppStorage on ObservableObject doesn't trigger onChange; custom Binding calls start/stop directly | Active |
| 2026-02-20 | **Credits window (not inline footer)** | Consolidates all attribution (MMF, Freepik icon) into dedicated window accessible from menubar | Active |
| 2026-02-20 | **Custom menubar icon (template)** | B&W icon with `template-rendering-intent` so macOS adapts it to light/dark mode | Active |
| 2026-02-20 | **App icon from Freepik/Flaticon** | Colored triskelion icon, resized via sips to all 10 required macOS sizes | Active |
| 2026-02-20 | **Removed minTickSize** | Was in config/UI but never used by engine; dead code removed | Active |
| 2026-02-20 | **Tick rate smoothing (rolling avg of 3)** | Matches MMF's RollingAverage(capacity: 3) for stable speed curve input | Active |
| 2026-02-20 | **velocityThreshold = 120** | Stops animation when <1 px/frame; old value (3.0) ran animation far too long | Active |
| 2026-02-20 | **Modifier hotkeys** | Customizable fast/slow modifier keys (Control/Option default) with multiplier sliders; uses CGEventSource.flagsState not event.flags | Active |
| 2026-02-20 | **Enable toggle in settings** | Custom Binding pattern (same as menubar) starts/stops ScrollEngine; syncs via shared config | Active |
| 2026-02-20 | **Removed curveExponent setting** | Effect was imperceptible — formula self-cancels at different c values; hardcoded to 1.5 | Active |
| 2026-02-20 | **Removed smoothness slider** | Effect was imperceptible due to compensation factor; momentum duration is the meaningful control | Active |
| 2026-02-20 | **Renamed momentum duration to "Smoothness" in UI** | User-facing label; internally still momentumDuration | Active |
| 2026-02-20 | **Capped momentum duration at 0.5** | Range 0.0–0.5 (was 0.0–2.0); values above 0.5 felt uncontrollable | Active |
| 2026-02-20 | **SmoothnessPreset includes Custom** | Matches SpeedPreset pattern; deselects when either smoothness or momentumDuration diverges from preset values | Active |
| 2026-02-23 | **Horizontal scroll: single-axis, no phases** | Single-axis events matching MMF continuous mode. No scroll phase fields (99/123). Shared gesture lifecycle across axes (no ended/began on axis switch). | Active |
| 2026-02-23 | **Shift removed from ModifierKey** | Shift+scroll = horizontal scroll (macOS default). Conflicts with modifier hotkey usage. | Active |
| 2026-02-23 | **Carbon RegisterEventHotKey for global hotkey** | No permissions needed for non-sandboxed apps. Callback verifies hotkey ID via GetEventParameter. | Active |
| 2026-02-23 | **SMAppService for launch at login** | Reads system status directly (no local @AppStorage). Users can remove login items from System Settings independently. | Active |
| 2026-02-23 | **velocityThreshold lowered to 30.0** | Was 120.0 (1 px/frame). At 30.0, slow single-tick scrolls get visible momentum (~360ms vs ~83ms). | Active |
| 2026-02-23 | **Fast scroll acceleration resets on direction/axis change** | consecutiveSwipeCount zeroed on direction reversal and axis switch to prevent carryover. | Active |
| 2026-02-23 | **CGEventTap callback uses passUnretained** | passRetained leaked every passthrough event. passUnretained is correct since system already owns the event. | Active |
| 2026-02-23 | **Scroll acceleration toggle** | Bypasses both computeSpeed() curve and fastScrollFactor() when disabled. Returns base speed directly. | Active |
| 2026-02-23 | **Reverse scroll direction per-axis** | Applied via effectiveDirection in processScroll. Separate toggles for vertical/horizontal. | Active |
| 2026-02-23 | **Scroll distance multiplier** | Applied after speed curve, before modifier hotkeys. Presets: Half(0.5x), Default(1.0x), Double(2.0x), Triple(3.0x). Range 0.25–3.0x. | Active |
| 2026-02-23 | **Tabbed settings window** | General/Advanced/Preview tabs. General opens first. Replaced single VStack layout. | Active |
| 2026-02-23 | **Expanded live preview** | Three test areas: vertical-only, horizontal-only, combined (both axes). PreviewTextView handles deltaX and deltaY. | Active |
| 2026-02-23 | **Resizable settings window** | Added .resizable to styleMask. Default 420x650. | Active |

## Scroll Engine Technical Details

### Event Construction (matches MMF)
- `CGEvent(source: nil)` — NOT `CGEventCreateScrollWheelEvent`
- Field 55 = 22 (event subtype)
- `scrollWheelEventIsContinuous` = 1
- `DeltaAxis1` = signedCeil(pixels / 10) — integer line delta
- `PointDeltaAxis1` = integer pixel delta
- `FixedPtDeltaAxis1` = (pixels / 10) * 65536 — 16.16 fixed-point LINE delta

### Key Constants
- `pixelsPerTick` = 45.0
- `pixelsPerLine` = 10.0
- `frameInterval` = 1/120
- `velocityThreshold` = 30.0

### Speed Curve
```
b = 1.1, c = 1.5 (hardcoded), t = 8.0, p = 1.33
a = (p - 1) / (b^c - 1)
multiplier = a * pow(b, (x - t) * c) + 1 - a
clamped to [1.0, 3.0]
```

## Constraints
- iCloud Drive sync — avoid large binary files or rapid file churn
- macOS-only (Darwin 25.3.0 dev environment)
- CGEventTap requires Accessibility permission from user on first launch
- Git repo root is inside Inertia folder (not home directory)
